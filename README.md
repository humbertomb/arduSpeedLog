# Arduino Speed Log Mk I

In this folder you can find files with the program and schematics of the control board fora simple paddlewheel based speed log. You can find the mechanical components for download at Thingiverse:

The working procedure of the speed log is simialr to those commercially available for boats ands yachts, but at an smaller scale. The intented use is two-fold: for the one hand showing how these systems work; for the other hand, allowing the use of a simple and inexpensive speed log for small DIY crafts.

Although the use of a small size GPS could do much the same with more accuracy, I have developed this for use in a small size low-cost ROV (Remotely Operated Vehicle) for underwater exploration. There, thers is no GPS at all.
